            <div class="paragraph">
                My name is Jonathan Andrade Valenzuela and I am currently in my 3rd 
                year of university studying Political Science. I have aspirations to work
                in the tech industry as a fullstack software engineer. Many people tend to ask
                about why I am studying Political Science when I want to be a SWE, and my answer to them
                is always quite long & personal, but to sum it up, I have grown up with a passion for 
                political science, however as time has passed on, I could not see myself working in the industry. 
                I took some time to reevaluate my plan, and I came to the conclusion that I can see myself working in tech
                as a career. I have a passion for creating things, and programming is the perfect outlet for me to do so.
